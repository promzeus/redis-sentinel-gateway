**Redis Sentinel Gateway** is a lightweight Go application designed to monitor Redis Sentinel for master node changes and automatically update Kubernetes Endpoints based on these changes. It simplifies the failover process by serving as a single point of entry for Redis, allowing clients to avoid dealing with Sentinel logic directly.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Master Node Detection**: Monitors Redis Sentinel for master node changes in real-time.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Automatically updates Kubernetes Endpoints based on the detected changes.
- **Leader Election**: Ensures high availability using Kubernetes leases for leader election.
- **Scalable**: Configurable polling and tick intervals for optimized performance and responsiveness.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for projects where low latency is critical for performance.
- **Simple to Use**: Single point of entry for Redis clients, avoiding the need to implement Sentinel logic in your applications.

## üõ† Configuration

The application is fully configurable via environment variables:

| Environment Variable        | Description                                          | Default Value         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `SERVICE_NAME`               | Name of the Kubernetes service                      | `redis-failover`      |
| `SENTINEL_ADDR`              | Address of the Redis Sentinel                        | `rfs-redis-node:26379`|
| `MASTER_NAME`                | Name of the Redis master in Sentinel                 | `mymaster`            |
| `NAMESPACE`                  | Kubernetes namespace (auto-detected if not set)      | Auto-detected         |
| `POLL_INTERVAL`              | Interval between Kubernetes Endpoint updates         | `10s`                 |
| `TICK_INTERVAL`              | Interval for checking master node changes            | `1s`                  |
| `LEASE_NAME`                 | Name of the Kubernetes lease for leader election     | `redis-failover-lease`|
| `PORT_NAME`                  | Name of the port for the service                     | `redis`               |
| `PORT_NUMBER`                | Port number for the service                          | `6379`                |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD`             | Password for connecting to Redis Sentinel            | None                  |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD_SECRET_NAME` | Secret name for Redis password                       | `redis-sentinel-server`|
| `REDIS_PASSWORD_KEY`         | Key in the secret for Redis password                 | `redis-password`      |
| `HOSTNAME`                   | Pod's hostname, used as a unique identifier          | Auto-detected         |

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Why Redis Sentinel Gateway?

Redis Sentinel Gateway provides a unique solution for managing Redis failover scenarios. Unlike other approaches that rely on complex integrations or higher latency options, this project is built with **low-latency** performance in mind. The gateway continuously monitors Redis Sentinel and instantly updates the Kubernetes Endpoints to reflect the current master node, ensuring minimal delay during failover events.

This makes **Redis Sentinel Gateway** ideal for projects where low latency is critical, such as:

- **Real-time applications**
- **Financial systems**
- **Gaming servers**
- **High-performance microservices architectures**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Monitoring**: The gateway continuously monitors Redis Sentinel for changes in the master node status.
2. **Automatic Updates**: When a master node change is detected, the Kubernetes Endpoints are automatically updated.
3. **Leader Election**: Using Kubernetes leases, only one instance of the gateway is responsible for updating the Endpoints at any time, ensuring high availability.
4. **Polling & Tick Intervals**: Configurable intervals control how frequently the application checks the Redis Sentinel and how often Kubernetes Endpoints are updated.

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

### Helm Chart

To install the Redis Sentinel Gateway via Helm, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Helm repository**:

    ```bash
    helm repo add redis-gateway https://promzeus.github.io/redis-sentinel-gateway
    ```

2. **Install the chart**:

    ```bash
    helm install redis-sentinel-gateway redis-gateway/redis-sentinel-gateway --namespace redis --create-namespace
    ```

3. **Upgrade the chart**:

    If you need to update the application with new changes, simply run:

    ```bash
    helm upgrade redis-sentinel-gateway redis-gateway/redis-sentinel-gateway --namespace redis
    ```

4. **Customizing the installation**:

You can override the default values for the chart by passing your own `values.yaml` file. For example:

```bash
helm install redis-sentinel-gateway redis-gateway/redis-sentinel-gateway --namespace redis --create-namespace -f values.yaml
```
